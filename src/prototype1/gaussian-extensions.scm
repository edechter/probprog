;; one big emit should definitely be supported
;; what about multiple emits? just do the environment thing, require every
;; execution exactly explains all the emitted data, then this system should
;; work on its own (with emit just setting values and the final emit, which
;; knows it's final because it explains the last datapoint, and then doing
;; usual thing)

;; emit only sets values that are uncollapsed; conditioning on a collapsed
;; value means it needs a likelihood, which could be provided by an uncollapsed

;; NOTE: could have a treewidth measure (largest number of g terms in a sum)
;; and do message passing below some threshold
